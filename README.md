# DataofRoK


The app is based on a game called Rise of Kingdom. I have already finished this app 
in design with Figma and an associated prototype. The app is especially close 
to my heart because we could save a lot of time in our game with it. 
The data that this app is supposed to calculate is based on the data from the entire game, 
it is supposed to display idas, energy, deaths, etc.. In addition, it should calculate a calculator for resources, 
ap's, accelerators, etc. what you have in the bag.
The first fragment is almost finished and I added it here as a picture.
